                        I am quite interested in learning languages. During my undergrad I learned Japanese 
                        and then went to 東洋大学 as a regular student. I then gave a 
                        <a href="pictures/speech.png">speech at graduation</a> as the exchange student 
                        representative. My favorite class was 
                        <a href="misc_files/学習心理学　期末レポート.pdf">学習心理学</a>. The professor was 
                        quite funny, and the content was great.

                    <h4>Mandarin</h4>
                    <p>
                        By the end of Ph.D, I aim to be of a comparable level in Mandarin as in Japanese. 
                        In order to do this, I spend about 1.5 hours every day studying Mandarin. This 
                        consists of 1 hour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">pure 
                        immersion</a> and about 30 minutes of 
                        <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download">spaced repetition study</a>.
                        I would like to be able to read 老子 by the end of the degree.

                        When in undergrad, I was quite passionate about language communities. I lead the 
                        Japanese Language Table and the Japanese Cultural Association. This was the most 
                        fun during undergrad, and I am honored to have met great people from around the world.

                        In general, jazz is my favorite genre. I like Coltrane 
                        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU">this</a> and 
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/ioPRCwpB1Ak?si=sjB5jiMi8M3XpH4d">this</a>). 
                        Other than jazz, classical is of course quite good. I also like 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJBtztG-xR4">hip-hop</a>.

                    <p>
                        Sleep, diet and exercise. I believe that motivation and success are not some sort of 
                        mental thing, but are direct products of how much you sleep, eat, and exercise. This 
                        is quite important to me. I tend to wake up around ~4:00AM and go to be around ~8:00PM. 
                        With regards to exercise, as I worry about my joints I enjoy swimming (I never knew they 
                        had <a href="https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/519051/">this</a> online), but typically 
                        just to weights.

                            not think I could re-watch it. In terms of re-watchable favorites, I really like 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(manga)">Monster</a> (the manga 
                            is also good).
