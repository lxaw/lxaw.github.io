        <h1>Personal Interests</h1>
        <i>What else is there?</i>
        
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Life Goals</h2>
        <p>Before I die, I need to have the following completed:</p>
        <p>1. 3 languages to fluency (English, Japanese, Mandarin)</p>
        <p>2. 100 million in investments (depositing about a third of each paycheck)</p>
        <p>3. Monthly donate to education/charities/space exploration</p>
        
        <p>At time of death:</p>
        <p>1. Still be physically and mentally fit</p>
        <p>2. At least have some people there</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>Languages</h2>
        
        <h3>Japanese</h3>
        <p>I learned Japanese during undergrad and went to 東洋大学 as a regular student. I gave a <a href="pictures/speech.png">speech at graduation</a> as the exchange student representative. My favorite class was <a href="misc_files/学習心理学　期末レポート.pdf">学習心理学</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Mandarin</h3>
        <p>By the end of Ph.D, I aim to be of a comparable level in Mandarin as in Japanese. I spend about 1.5 hours every day studying - 1 hour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">pure immersion</a> and 30 minutes of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download">spaced repetition study</a>. I would like to read 老子 by the end of the degree.</p>
        
        <h3>Language Communities</h3>
        <p>In undergrad, I led the Japanese Language Table and Japanese Cultural Association. This was the most fun during undergrad, and I met great people from around the world.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Jazz is my favorite genre. I like Coltrane (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU">this</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ioPRCwpB1Ak?si=sjB5jiMi8M3XpH4d">this</a>). I also like classical and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJBtztG-xR4">hip-hop</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>My favorite genre is sci-fi. You can see the <a href="books_read.html">books that I read</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>Sleep, diet and exercise are critical. I believe motivation and success are direct products of how much you sleep, eat, and exercise. I wake up around 4:00AM and go to bed around 8:00PM. I enjoy swimming (they have <a href="https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/519051/">this</a> online), but typically do weights now.</p>
        
        <h2>Shows, Movies, Characters</h2>
        <p>Favorite color movie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception</a>. Favorite black and white movie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1957_film)">Twelve Angry Men</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Favorite TV show is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Pool_(The_Twilight_Zone,_1959)">The Twilight Zone</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(manga)">Monster</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In terms of personality, I would like to be like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qOCckM6hMM">古畑任三郎</a>. He was always kind and had a good sense of humor.</p>
