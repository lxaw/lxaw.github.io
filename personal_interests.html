    <b>What else is there?</b>
    <p>Before I die, I need to have the following completed:</p>
    <p>1. 4 languages to fluency (English, Japanese, Mandarin, German)</p>
    <p>2. 100 million in investments (depositing about a third of each paycheck)</p>
    <p>3. Monthly donate to education/charities/space exploration</p>
    <p>At time of death:</p>
    <p>1. Still be physically and mentally fit</p>
    <p>2. At least have some people there</p>
    <b>Languages</b>
    <br>
    <i>Japanese</i>
    <p>My grandfather was Fukuokan (なので僕は一応形式上日系三世かな？）. I gave a <a href="pictures/speech.png">speech at graduation</a> as the exchange student representative. My favorite class was <a href="misc_files/学習心理学　期末レポート.pdf">学習心理学</a>.</p>
    <i>Mandarin</i>
    <p>By the end of my 20s, I aim to be fluent in Mandarin. Chinese literature is really interesting, and the history is quite rich. Would be great to know more. </p>
    <i>German</i>
    <p>I started learning German recently. My sister lives over there, and I like the place.</p>
    <b>Music</b>
    <p>Jazz is my favorite genre. I like Coltrane (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU">this</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ioPRCwpB1Ak?si=sjB5jiMi8M3XpH4d">this</a>). I also like classical and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJBtztG-xR4">hip-hop</a>.</p>
    <b>Books</b>
    <p>My favorite genre is sci-fi. You can see the <a href="books_read.html">books that I read</a>.</p>
    <b>Exercise</b>
    <p>Sleep, diet and exercise are critical. I believe motivation and success are direct products of how much you sleep, eat, and exercise. I used to wake up around 4:00AM and go to bed around 8:00PM. However, since I am still young I try to go out more, so its more like 5/6 AM to 9/10PM.</p>
    <b>Shows, Movies, Characters</b>
    <p>Favorite color movie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception</a>. Favorite black and white movie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1957_film)">Twelve Angry Men</a>.</p>
    <p>Favorite TV show is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Pool_(The_Twilight_Zone,_1959)">The Twilight Zone</a> or <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%8A%80%E6%B2%B3%E8%8B%B1%E9%9B%84%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC">Legend of the Galactic Heroes</a>.</p>
    <p>In terms of personality, I would like to be like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qOCckM6hMM">古畑任三郎</a>. He was always kind and had a good sense of humor.</p>
