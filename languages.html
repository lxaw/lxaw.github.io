    <h1>Language Learning</h1>
    <h4>For human beings</h4>
    <p>
        In general, <a href = "https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> will be your best bet. The idea is to memorize using Anki, and learn via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_immersion#References">immersion</a>, specifically using the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">input hypothesis</a>.
        I did this immersion method for about ~3 years with Japanese and was able to be fluent enough to go to college with regular students in Tokyo. It works, just trust the method.
