    "description": "This paper introduces SpanBERT, a pre-training method that improves upon BERT by focusing on span-level representations rather than individual tokens. The key innovations are: (1) masking contiguous random spans of text rather than individual tokens, using a geometric distribution to sample span lengths; and (2) introducing a Span Boundary Objective (SBO) that trains the model to predict the entire content of masked spans using only the representations of tokens at the span boundaries, plus position embeddings. Additionally, SpanBERT uses single-sequence training without BERT's Next Sentence Prediction objective, which proves more effective than bi-sequence training. The method achieves substantial improvements on span selection tasks like question answering (94.6% F1 on SQuAD 1.1, 88.7% on SQuAD 2.0) and coreference resolution (79.6% F1 on OntoNotes), demonstrating that span-focused pre-training objectives can significantly enhance performance on tasks requiring span-level reasoning.",

    "description": "This paper introduces UNILM (UNIfied pre-trained Language Model), a single Transformer model that can be fine-tuned for both natural language understanding and generation tasks by using different self-attention masks during pre-training. The model is jointly trained on three language modeling objectives: unidirectional (left-to-right and right-to-left), bidirectional, and sequence-to-sequence prediction, with the key innovation being the use of specific attention masks to control what context each token can access during prediction. UNILM achieves competitive performance with BERT on understanding tasks like GLUE and question answering, while establishing new state-of-the-art results on five generation tasks including CNN/DailyMail summarization, question generation, and dialog response generation. The unified approach eliminates the need for separate models for different tasks while enabling parameter sharing that leads to more general text representations and better performance across both understanding and generation applications.",

The key innovation is constructing target probability paths and vector fields through conditional formulations per data sample, then showing that optimizing a Conditional Flow Matching objective (which is tractable) provides identical gradients to the intractable Flow Matching objective. The framework supports a general family of Gaussian probability paths, including both existing diffusion paths and a novel Optimal Transport (OT) path that creates straight-line trajectories with constant direction, making it simpler to learn than curved diffusion paths. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate that FM with OT paths achieves superior performance in likelihood estimation and sample quality while requiring fewer function evaluations for sampling, offering faster training and generation compared to traditional diffusion methods.",

Key practical contributions include a general family of probability paths with different schedulers, unified corrector sampling techniques, and the ability to scale to large models (1.7B parameters) that achieve competitive results on coding benchmarks like HumanEval (6.7% Pass@1) and text generation tasks.

The authors identify three \"Golden Principles\" governing effective dLLM sampling: the Certainty Principle (high-confidence tokens are more stable), the Convergence Principle (token confidences stabilize over iterations), and the Positional Principle (high-confidence tokens cluster in contiguous regions). Based on these principles, they design a dynamic two-stage approach that alternates between an Exploratory Stage (cautious decoding to identify stable regions) and an Accelerated Decoding Stage (aggressive parallel decoding within identified stable spans). Experiments show SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA alone and up to 34.22× when combined with dLLM-Cache, while maintaining generation quality and even outperforming autoregressive models like LLaMA3 8B in throughput.",

The authors identify that existing methods cause large cumulative quantization errors and fail to properly calibrate on long-context data due to Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) characteristics. PM-KVQ introduces progressive quantization that gradually reduces bit-width as memory fills up and block-wise memory allocation that assigns higher precision to more sensitive transformer blocks. To address calibration issues, they propose using short-context data with positional interpolation to approximate long-context distributions without additional computational overhead. Experiments on 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs demonstrate up to 8% improvement in reasoning benchmark performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory constraints.",

The authors find that most massive activations are propagated through residual connections rather than being newly generated, and these \"fake\" MAs can be safely removed without affecting model accuracy. They discover that channel-wise outliers primarily emerge from normalization operations, specifically the rescaling step within LayerNorm/RMSNorm layers. Based on these insights, they propose efficient methods to eliminate the majority of both types of outliers with minimal impact on model performance, simplifying subsequent quantization processes.",

To address training instability and prevent degenerate solutions common in data-free distillation of language models, the authors propose an adversarial regularization approach that combines score matching loss with adversarial training, using the same network for both score estimation and GAN discrimination. The framework includes a two-stage training strategy where the first stage produces a reasonably good student model, and the second stage reinitializes the score estimator with teacher parameters to provide better learning signals for continued improvement, achieving up to 500× speedup over iterative diffusion methods while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks.",

The key contribution is identifying that DiT quantization difficulties stem from time-dependent, channel-specific activation outliers that vary across denoising timesteps, making traditional static quantization approaches ineffective. The authors propose a two-pronged solution: (1) temporally-grouped channel-wise shifting that uses hierarchical clustering to group similar timesteps and applies channel-wise shifts to center asymmetric outlier distributions, and (2) temporally-aggregated channel-wise scaling that transfers quantization difficulty from activations to weights using exponential moving averages of outlier magnitudes across timesteps.

The core technical innovation is a unified attention mechanism using attention bias matrices that allows a single transformer to dynamically switch between causal (AR-style) and bidirectional (MDM-style) attention patterns, with two variants: Eso-LM (A) that sparsifies attention over mask tokens, and Eso-LM (B) that enforces causal attention among clean tokens to enable KV caching. The method employs a two-phase sampling strategy where tokens are first generated in parallel via diffusion (with custom denoising schedules that avoid processing unnecessary mask tokens), followed by sequential left-to-right completion of remaining masked positions, with Eso-LM (B) uniquely supporting KV caching throughout both phases. Empirically, Eso-LMs achieve state-of-the-art perplexity among diffusion models while delivering substantial speedups (up to 65× faster than standard MDMs and 4× faster than block diffusion approaches), establishing a new Pareto frontier for the speed-quality tradeoff in non-autoregressive language generation.",

    "description": "This paper addresses the fundamental challenge that diffusion language models (dLLMs), while theoretically capable of parallel token generation, fail to achieve competitive speed-quality tradeoffs compared to autoregressive models when generating multiple tokens simultaneously due to poor intra-token dependency modeling. The core contribution is Adaptive Parallel Decoding (APD), which inverts the speculative decoding paradigm by using a small auxiliary autoregressive model to verify parallel samples from a larger diffusion model, employing a multiplicative mixture of the dLLM's marginal probabilities and the autoregressive model's joint probabilities to determine how many tokens to accept in each iteration. The method incorporates several practical optimizations including KV caching for diffusion models (despite their bidirectional attention), masked input size limiting, and universal coupling via the Gumbel-Softmax trick to ensure valid sampling, resulting in three tunable hyperparameters that enable flexible speed-quality tradeoffs. Empirically, APD achieves Pareto-optimal performance by generating 5+ tokens per iteration while maintaining high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that dynamic parallel sampling can overcome the sharp tradeoff between parallelization and quality that plagues naive approaches.",

The authors develop a highly efficient strong-to-weak distillation pipeline that leverages both off-policy and on-policy knowledge transfer from larger teacher models, achieving superior performance compared to traditional reinforcement learning while requiring only 1/10th the computational resources and enabling lightweight models to match the reasoning capabilities of much larger counterparts. The training methodology employs a sophisticated four-stage post-training process (long-CoT cold start, reasoning RL, thinking mode fusion, general RL) combined with three-stage pre-training on 36 trillion tokens across 119 languages, utilizing architectural innovations like fine-grained expert segmentation in MoE models with global-batch load balancing and QK-normalization for training stability.",

The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing that both the bias and variance introduced by this approximation are governed by the variance of the preference score estimator—a linear combination of four ELBO terms. They propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO), which employs three unbiased variance reduction techniques: increasing the Monte Carlo sampling budget for ELBOs, optimally allocating the sampling budget across distinct diffusion timesteps with one masked sample per timestep, and applying antithetic sampling by sharing the same random samples between current and reference policy ELBO estimates.

The key insight is that well-trained frequent position indices can be strategically shifted to replace undertrained distant positions during inference, allowing models to leverage their existing positional knowledge for long-range dependencies. STRING is implemented by manipulating the position matrix through three steps: dropping infrequent positions beyond a threshold, shifting frequent positions from the main diagonal to fill the empty bottom-left triangle, and restoring locality with a small window to maintain neighboring token relationships. The method can be efficiently implemented using FlashAttention by combining sliding window attention around the diagonal with shifted self-attention in the bottom-left triangle, requiring no additional training while dramatically improving long-context performance within existing training lengths.",

The authors demonstrate that adapter-based parameter-efficient training provides a better trade-off between toxicity reduction and model quality preservation compared to full model fine-tuning, especially for large-scale models. The paper also reveals that model toxicity primarily stems from training data rather than model size, as larger models show similar toxicity levels to smaller ones when trained on the same corpus, though they require more effort to detoxify effectively.",

The key innovation is adapting the masked diffusion training objective to multimodal dialogues by keeping image features and prompts unmasked while randomly masking only the response tokens, enabling the model to predict masked tokens using bidirectional context from both visual and textual information. During inference, the model generates responses iteratively through the reverse diffusion process, starting with fully masked responses and progressively unmasking high-confidence predictions while re-masking low-confidence ones.

The authors develop two approaches—independent marginal sampling and autoregressive sampling—with the latter capturing dependencies between outputs for superior performance by maintaining information across predictions. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate LLMPs perform competitively with specialized statistical methods like Gaussian Processes across diverse tasks including forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, image reconstruction, and black-box optimization. Most significantly, the research shows how conditioning on textual information meaningfully alters predictive distributions to create forecasts that incorporate real-world knowledge not explicitly present in numerical data, such as seasonal patterns or domain-specific constraints.",

The authors develop parallelized inference and generation processes using dynamic programming that can adaptively determine which steps to parallelize, creating a flexible tradeoff between generation speed and model quality while requiring significantly fewer steps than discrete diffusion models to achieve equivalent performance. ARDMs are also extended with \"depth upscaling\" capabilities that structure the generation process into multiple stages of progressive refinement (such as bit-by-bit generation), which proves particularly effective for lossless compression tasks where ARDMs outperform competing approaches, especially in single-image compression scenarios.",

The method frames data mixture construction as a search problem and solves it through a bootstrapping strategy where candidate mixtures are iteratively proposed, pruned, and refined to optimize diversity and domain relevance.

The approach employs an efficient verification mechanism where the base model scores each speculated step in a single prefill-only pass that requires only ∼70 new tokens, with adjustable acceptance thresholds to control the aggressiveness of speculation and balance the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Furthermore, SpecReason can be combined with traditional speculative decoding in a hierarchical speculation scheme that provides an additional 19.4-44.2% latency reduction over speculative decoding alone, demonstrating the complementary nature of these two approaches.",

This plan-and-denoise approach allows for adaptive time discretization and error correction, as the planner can identify when the sequence is noisier than expected or when errors were introduced in earlier steps, adjusting sampling to ensure all corrupted tokens are accurately reconstructed. The authors derive simple and effective training objectives for both planner and denoiser models grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for discrete diffusion processes, enabling independent training of each component. Experimental results on language modeling tasks (text8, OpenWebText) and token-based image generation (ImageNet 256×256) demonstrate that DDPD significantly outperforms traditional mask diffusion methods, reducing the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive approaches especially in terms of generative perplexity, while also showing that a planner can enhance generation quality even when using a smaller or weaker denoiser model compared to baseline methods.",

They show that diffusion models effectively decompose these challenging subgoals into more manageable interrelated views within a multi-view learning framework, resulting in superior performance. Building on these insights, they propose Multi-Granularity Diffusion Modeling (MGDM), which prioritizes subgoals based on difficulty during learning, leading to more effective outcomes and faster convergence. Their experimental evaluation focuses on complex problem-solving tasks like Countdown (a mathematical reasoning challenge), Sudoku, and Boolean Satisfiability Problems. For problems like math reasoning or Sudoku where later steps directly depend on earlier ones, this creates a \"plan as you go\" approach that's inherently flawed. Diffusion models transform hard subgoals into multiple interrelated \"views\" during the denoising process. Each view offers a different perspective on the same problem, creating a more manageable learning objective. The authors identified a phenomenon they call the \"Regretful Compromise\" where AR models, after making early mistakes, are forced to produce clearly incorrect calculations in final steps to reach the target answer. The iterative nature of diffusion models naturally promotes global consistency.

    "description": "This paper investigates whether transformers \"think ahead\" during inference by preparing information in hidden states that will be useful for future tokens. The authors propose two hypotheses: the \"pre-caching\" hypothesis (where models deliberately compute features irrelevant to the current token but useful for future tokens) and the \"breadcrumbs\" hypothesis (where features helpful for current prediction naturally benefit future tokens without deliberate planning). To test these hypotheses, the researchers develop \"myopic training\", where models are trained without propagating gradients to past timesteps. They first create a synthetic task that can only be solved via pre-caching, confirming that transformers can learn this capability when necessary. However, in natural language modeling with smaller models like GPT-2, they find minimal pre-caching, suggesting the breadcrumbs hypothesis predominates—models compute features relevant to the immediate next token that happen to benefit future tokens, without significant trade-offs. Interestingly, the authors discover that pre-caching increases with model scale, becoming more significant with larger models like Pythia 2.8B. This indicates that larger language models may indeed \"plan for the future\" in ways smaller models cannot. They also examine multiplication tasks, finding evidence that pre-caching enables computation on \"filler tokens\" that improves overall performance.",

    "description": "This paper presents a method for efficiently training neural networks with discrete random variables. The Gumbel-Softmax is a continuous relaxation of categorical distributions that addresses the challenge of backpropagating through discrete random variables in neural networks. It builds upon the Gumbel-Max trick, which samples from categorical distributions by adding Gumbel noise to logits and taking the argmax, but replaces the non-differentiable argmax operation with a differentiable softmax function controlled by a temperature parameter τ. When the temperature approaches zero, the distribution approximates a categorical one-hot vector, while higher temperatures yield more uniform distributions. This temperature can be gradually annealed during training to balance exploration and discrete decision-making. For applications requiring truly discrete outputs, the Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax variant uses argmax in the forward pass while preserving differentiable gradients through the softmax in the backward pass. This technique has enabled significant advances in training neural networks with discrete variables, categorical variational autoencoders, and efficient semi-supervised learning algorithms, solving a fundamental limitation in stochastic neural networks.",

Despite their success in many tasks, even large language models struggle with mathematics due to the sensitivity to individual errors in step-by-step reasoning. The authors propose a verification approach to improve performance: they first finetune a generator model, then train a separate verifier model to judge the correctness of potential solutions. At test time, they generate multiple candidate solutions and select the highest-ranked one. This verification method significantly outperforms basic finetuning, providing performance equivalent to a 30x increase in model size.",

First, the authors introduce Shifted Sparse Attention (S²-Attn), which divides the input sequence into multiple groups and performs attention only within each group, then critically shifts the group partitioning by half a group size in 50% of attention heads to ensure information flows between groups. This approximates full attention during training while dramatically reducing computational costs. Second, they enhance Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by making embedding and normalization layers trainable—components that comprise less than 2% of model parameters but prove essential for long-context adaptation. Their experiments demonstrate this approach closes the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning while maintaining significantly lower memory requirements. Importantly, models trained with S²-Attn retain standard attention during inference, ensuring compatibility with existing optimization techniques like Flash-Attention2, making LongLoRA a practical solution that enables extending Llama2 models to context lengths of up to 100K tokens on modest hardware setups.",

    "description": "This paper introduces Parallel Prompt Decoding (PPD), a memory-efficient approach for accelerating Large Language Model inference by using trainable prompt tokens to enable parallel token generation. Unlike existing speculative decoding methods that require separate draft models, PPD works by training only the embeddings of special prompt tokens (0.0002% of parameters) that are strategically inserted into the input sequence at positions where future tokens are expected to be generated. The prompt tokens partially recover conditional dependency information necessary for accurate multi-token prediction, with the authors using Knowledge Distillation to train the prompt token embeddings against the original LLM's logits while keeping the base model frozen. They enhance accuracy through Ensemble Prompt Tokens (EPTs), where multiple trained embeddings represent each prompt position with specialized attention masking to ensure each EPT only depends on corresponding EPTs from preceding positions. To optimize performance across hardware, they developed a hardware-aware dynamic sparse tree technique that adaptively determines the optimal tree structure and balances the number of candidate tokens versus prompt tokens at each decoding step based on token acceptance probabilities and computational resources. Experiments across models from MobileLlama to Vicuna-13B demonstrate up to 2.49× inference speedup with minimal memory overhead (0.0004%) while maintaining output quality, and PPD can be combined with existing speculative decoding methods for further performance improvements.",

Unlike previous approaches that rely on hand-crafted heuristics tied to specific syntactic structures like lists and paragraphs, PASTA uses a learning-based approach. The system consists of three components: (1) a specialized annotation language (PASTA-LANG) that allows LLMs to express semantic independence in their own responses using tags like <promise> and <sync/>; (2) an interpreter that orchestrates asynchronous decoding at inference time based on these annotations; and (3) a two-stage finetuning process that teaches LLMs to generate effective annotations that optimize both response quality and decoding speed.",

The key innovation is a mathematically rigorous framework for controlling the outputs of discrete diffusion and flow models by leveraging continuous-time Markov processes. The authors tackle a fundamental challenge in discrete guidance: the intractability of computing the normalizing constant in Bayes' theorem, which would normally require summing over an exponentially large state space. They overcome this by exploiting the fact that in continuous-time Markov chains, only one dimension of the state can change at any instant, making exact guidance computationally feasible. The paper develops both predictor guidance (PG) and predictor-free guidance (PFG) variants, along with a computationally efficient approximation called Taylor-approximated guidance (TAG). They demonstrate their method's effectiveness across multiple domains including small-molecule generation, DNA sequence design, and protein engineering. Notably, their framework enables repurposing existing unconditional generative models by modulating their behavior with guidance signals, avoiding the need for retraining on limited labeled data. This approach creates new possibilities for controllable generation in scientific applications where discrete representations are essential, such as molecular and biological sequence design.",

    "description": "The ToCa (Token-wise Feature Caching) methodology accelerates diffusion transformers through a sophisticated token selection strategy for caching. The approach begins with cache initialization at the first timestep where all tokens are computed and stored, followed by selective computing in subsequent timesteps based on a pre-defined caching ratio R. Unlike traditional methods, ToCa updates the cache with newly computed values at every timestep to reduce error accumulation. The heart of ToCa is its caching score function, which combines four critical criteria: the token's influence on other tokens through self-attention (s1), its importance for text conditioning via cross-attention entropy (s2), how frequently it has been cached (s3), and whether caching it maintains uniform spatial distribution (s4). ToCa further refines its approach by applying different caching ratios to different layers, with deeper layers receiving higher caching ratios since errors in them have less opportunity to propagate, while shallow layers get lower ratios. The method also distinguishes between layer types, handling self-attention layers differently from MLP layers to prevent error propagation. Additional engineering optimizations include timestep-dependent scheduling and consistent token selection between conditional and unconditional paths. By intelligently selecting which tokens can be safely cached based on their specific characteristics and position in the network, ToCa achieves significant speedups while maintaining generation quality across different diffusion transformer architectures.",

Using a computation graph framework to measure task complexity across multi-digit multiplication, logic puzzles, and dynamic programming problems, the authors demonstrate that LLMs solve compositional tasks through pattern matching rather than systematic reasoning, performing well on in-distribution examples but failing dramatically on out-of-distribution cases even after extensive fine-tuning with explicit reasoning steps. Their error analysis shows that while models can perform single-step operations correctly, they fail to compose these steps into correct reasoning paths, with errors propagating through the computation graph because the autoregressive nature of transformers forces them to tackle problems sequentially through a greedy process of producing the next token without developing a global understanding of the task. Both empirical findings and mathematical analysis reveal a fundamental limitation where error probability increases exponentially with task complexity, suggesting transformers may be inherently limited in solving complex compositional tasks without additional mechanisms. The paper concludes that transformers are best suited for tasks with few reasoning steps, tasks allowing approximate solutions, or when combined with planning modules or refinement methods to overcome the limitations of their autoregressive architecture.",

This capability gap widens with increasing task complexity and presents more starkly than in human intelligence, where understanding typically precedes generation ability. The research suggests this divergence stems from fundamental differences in how AI systems and humans develop intelligence—models are trained directly on reproducing expert-like outputs without requiring deep understanding.

In the pre-obfuscation phase, which is performed just once, the system identifies key stylistic axes that differentiate authors, including text length, function word usage, grade level, formality, voice, sarcasm, and writing type. For each of these style axes, the researchers create parallel datasets where identical content is rewritten in different stylistic directions, which are then used to train lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules that can be integrated with a larger base language model. During the actual obfuscation phase, STYLEREMIX analyzes the author's text to create an \"author vector\" measuring their style along various axes and compares this to the average style vector of all authors in the same domain to identify which style elements are most distinctive for this specific author. Based on this analysis, the system selectively applies the appropriate LoRA adapters with calculated weights to steer the text away from the author's most recognizable style elements. These adapters can be applied sequentially, through adapter merging (combining weights before applying), or using LoraHub+ (which optimizes the weights through gradient-free optimization). What makes STYLEREMIX innovative is its adaptive approach to identifying and targeting the specific style elements that make an author recognizable, rather than applying generic transformations, resulting in more effective obfuscation while maintaining content integrity and fluency.",

They mathematically prove that MDMs' continuous-time Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) can be reformulated based on the number of masked tokens rather than time, effectively showing that the time variable serves merely as a continuous relaxation of the masked ratio. Building on this insight, they develop the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS), which analytically calculates when each masked token should be unmasked, enabling token-by-token decoding that is provably equivalent to MDMs' original sampling process but 20 times faster. The authors also uncover a critical numerical precision issue in Gumbel-based categorical sampling where 32-bit floating-point representation truncates maximum Gumbel values, artificially lowering the effective temperature during sampling. Through closed-form mathematical analysis, they demonstrate how this truncation shifts probability distributions and creates unequal unmasking probabilities across token positions, explaining why MDMs appeared to outperform auto-regressive models in previous evaluations when measured by generative perplexity. Their high-order sampling variants (using extrapolation and predictor-corrector approaches) further enhance efficiency while maintaining theoretical equivalence to the original MDM sampling process.",

    "description": "The paper introduces DeepInversion, a method that synthesizes realistic, high-fidelity images from a trained CNN without requiring access to the original training data by using information stored in batch normalization layers. The authors further enhance this technique with Adaptive DeepInversion, which improves image diversity by maximizing Jensen-Shannon divergence between teacher and student network outputs. With these methods, the paper demonstrates three data-free applications: network pruning, knowledge transfer between models, and continual learning for adding new classes to existing networks. The synthesized images show impressive realism and generalize well across different model architectures, enabling knowledge distillation and other tasks that typically require the original training dataset.",

    "description": "This paper introduces sequence-level knowledge distillation for neural machine translation, allowing smaller student models to achieve performance comparable to larger teacher models. The authors demonstrate that their approach works better than standard word-level knowledge distillation by having students learn from complete translations generated by the teacher rather than just matching word-level probabilities. Remarkably, their method enables student models to perform well even with greedy decoding, eliminating the need for computationally expensive beam search at inference time. Combining their distillation techniques with weight pruning, they produce models with 13× fewer parameters than the original teacher model while maintaining strong translation performance, making efficient NMT deployment possible even on mobile devices.",

The researchers developed a multistage distillation approach combining progressive distillation, supervised fine-tuning, and directed preference optimization, which outperforms models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens. They also introduced a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that significantly accelerates inference speed for both Mamba and hybrid architectures, achieving impressive throughput for large language models. The resulting hybrid models show comparable performance to the original Transformers on chat benchmarks while requiring less computational resources for deployment, highlighting how transformer knowledge can be effectively transferred to other architectures with customized inference profiles.",

The authors demonstrate MergeNet's effectiveness through extensive experiments across challenging scenarios including cross-structure (different model architectures), cross-modal (image-text), and cross-task (classification-QA) knowledge transfer, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

They find that the optimal point to switch between data distributions occurs at one-fifth of the maximum learning rate, and demonstrate that their approach yields a 9% improvement in model accuracy compared to simply continuing training on the pretraining dataset. The recipe proves effective across different training scales (from 100B to 1T tokens) and includes innovations like document mining to identify the most useful examples for continued training, enabling developers to improve model capabilities without the massive computational costs of retraining from scratch.",

The authors identify \"regularization samples\" where distillation primarily acts as a regularizer and find that their quantity negatively correlates with model performance in standard knowledge distillation. To address this, they propose \"weighted soft labels\" that adaptively weight each training sample's contribution to optimally balance the bias-variance tradeoff, leading to improved distillation performance. The key insight is that regularization samples shouldn't be completely ignored but rather have their influence carefully modulated through weighting, which the authors validate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments establishing new state-of-the-art results.",

They discover that LLMs are surprisingly robust to removing up to half of their layers, suggesting either that current pretraining methods don't fully utilize deeper layers or that shallow layers play a crucial role in storing knowledge. A key finding is that while question-answering performance shows a sharp transition after removing critical layers, autoregressive loss changes smoothly, indicating an interesting disconnect between these different measures of model capability.",

They make the key insight that if you insert linear layers with the orthogonal matrix Q before RMSNorm and Q^{T} after, the network remains unchanged, i.e. RMSNorm(XQ)Q^{T} = RMSNorm(X). They also note that since LayerNorm can be converted to RMSNorm, LayerNorm is the same story. To find the Qs they use a calibration dataset from the training set and run it thru the model.

Unlike traditional models that flatten 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, VAR preserves spatial locality and leverages multi-scale visual representations to reduce computational inefficiencies. By adopting hierarchical generation aligned with natural image structures, VAR overcomes the limitations of standard autoregressive models, such as mathematical premise violations and loss of spatial coherence.

The framework also adapts to networks with group structures, such as those using multi-head attention or group normalization, by proposing modifications to unit-matching algorithms.

The authors provide key theoretical insights about what properties a similarity metric should have - arguing it should be invariant to orthogonal transformations and isotropic scaling, but not to arbitrary invertible linear transformations, as neural network training itself isn't invariant to such transformations. They show that for representations with more dimensions than training examples, any metric invariant to arbitrary invertible transformations will give meaningless results. CKA works by first measuring the similarity between every pair of examples in each representation separately (creating representational similarity matrices), then comparing these similarity structures - when using inner products, this reduces to computing normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion between the representations. They demonstrate theoretically that CKA is closely related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and regression, but incorporates feature scale information that CCA discards. Finally, they show that unlike previous methods like CCA and SVCCA, CKA can reliably identify corresponding layers between networks trained from different initializations and reveal meaningful relationships between different architectures.",

The study revealed that models fine-tuned from pre-trained weights tend to stay in the same basin in the loss landscape, make similar mistakes, and remain close to each other in parameter space, while models trained from scratch end up in different basins with more diverse behaviors. By analyzing module criticality, they found that lower layers handle more general features while higher layers become more specialized, confirming previous theories about feature hierarchy in neural networks. Finally, they showed that transfer learning can begin from earlier checkpoints of the pre-trained model without losing accuracy, suggesting that the benefits of pre-training emerge before the model fully converges on the source task.",

The key insight is that when merging models trained on different tasks, it's often better to combine similar features within each model first, rather than forcing dissimilar features from different models to merge, as these features may have developed to solve fundamentally different problems. Their method first concatenates the feature spaces of both models and computes a comprehensive correlation matrix between all features (both within and across models), using these correlations to guide intelligent feature merging decisions. To handle the multi-layer nature of neural networks, they introduce an \"unmerge\" operation that allows the merged features to remain compatible with later layers in both original networks, essentially decompressing the merged features before they're processed by subsequent layers. Theoretically, they prove that this approach provides better guarantees than traditional cross-model merging, showing that when models have internal redundancy (which is common in practice), their method can achieve perfect merging with zero performance loss.",

The key insight is that by systematically choosing examples where the model shows high uncertainty, and then having humans provide detailed reasoning chains for those specific cases, the resulting prompts will be more effective at teaching the model how to approach challenging problems.

This approach is more stable and efficient than RLHF because it uses standard supervised learning techniques rather than RL, while being less sensitive to reward scaling issues since it only uses relative rankings rather than absolute reward values. Additionally, the decoupled nature of RAFT means it requires less memory (only needs to load one model at a time vs multiple for RLHF) and allows more flexibility in data collection and processing.",

They design an asymmetric loss function where clean images use exponential/softmax loss (to focus on hard examples) while detection dataset uses linear loss (to give equal weight to all examples), helping isolate the watermark signal. This is combined with an iterative pruning strategy that gradually removes likely-clean images from the detection set, allowing the model to better focus on and learn the watermark patterns.

Building on this understanding, they propose Heterogeneous Model Averaging (HMA) which applies different averaging ratios to different layers of the transformer model, allowing optimization of the alignment-forgetting trade-off. The intuition is that since different layers capture different levels of features and task similarities, they should not be averaged equally, and finding optimal layer-specific averaging ratios can better preserve both alignment and pre-trained capabilities.",

To further enhance efficiency, they introduce stride denoising, which completes multiple denoising steps simultaneously through a single parallel computation batch and reduces the frequency of communication between devices.

Classical zeroth-order methods scale poorly with model size, but MeZO adapts these approaches to leverage structured pre-trained model landscapes, avoiding catastrophic slowdown even with billions of parameters. The authors theoretically show that MeZO’s convergence depends on the local effective rank of the Hessian, not the number of parameters, enabling efficient optimization despite prior bounds suggesting otherwise. Furthermore, MeZO’s flexibility allows optimization of non-differentiable objectives (e.g., accuracy or F1 score) and compatibility with parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA and prefix-tuning.",

The authors observe that pre-Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) keys exhibit a low-rank structure, allowing them to be compressed without accuracy loss, while value caches lack this property and are therefore offloaded to the CPU to reduce GPU memory usage. To minimize decoding latency, they leverage landmarks—compact representations of the low-rank key cache—and identify a small set of outliers to be retained on the GPU, enabling efficient reconstruction of sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. This approach allows the system to handle significantly longer contexts and larger batch sizes while maintaining inference throughput and accuracy.",

Building on this, the authors propose Layerwise Importance Sampling AdamW (LISA), which randomly freezes most middle layers during training, using importance sampling to emulate LoRA’s fast learning pattern while avoiding its low-rank constraints. This approach achieves significant memory savings, faster convergence, and superior performance compared to LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning, particularly in large-scale and domain-specific tasks.",

The method first consolidates outliers from activations to weights through smoothing, then decomposes the weights using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to separate the dominant components into a 16-bit low-rank branch while keeping the residual in 4 bits. To make this practical, they developed an inference engine called Nunchaku that fuses the low-rank and low-bit branch kernels together, eliminating redundant memory access that would otherwise negate the performance benefits. The approach is designed to work across different diffusion model architectures and can seamlessly integrate with existing low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without requiring re-quantization.",

The key insight is that when considering model size as a constraint and allowing network width to vary, some bitwidths consistently outperform others - specifically, networks with standard convolutions work better with binary weights while networks with depthwise convolutions prefer higher bitwidths. The authors discover that this difference is related to the number of input channels (fan-in) per convolutional kernel, with higher fan-in making networks more resilient to aggressive quantization. Most surprisingly, they demonstrate that using a single well-chosen bitwidth throughout the network can outperform more complex mixed-precision quantization approaches when comparing networks of equal size, suggesting that the traditional focus on minimizing bitwidth without considering network width may be suboptimal.",

Unlike previous approaches that require multiple training phases or complex scheduling, shortcut models can be trained end-to-end in a single phase by leveraging a self-consistency property where one large step should equal two consecutive smaller steps, combined with flow-matching loss as a base case. The key insight is that by conditioning on step size, the model can account for future curvature in the denoising path and jump directly to the correct next point rather than following the curved path naively, which would lead to errors with large steps. The approach simplifies the training pipeline while maintaining flexibility in inference budget, as the same model can generate samples using either single or multiple steps after training.",

The key insight is that this decoupling improves optimization by making the conditioning of the gradient better - the direction and scale of weight updates can be learned somewhat independently, which helps avoid problems with pathological curvature in the optimization landscape. While inspired by batch normalization, weight normalization is deterministic and doesn't add noise to gradients or create dependencies between minibatch examples, making it well-suited for scenarios like reinforcement learning and RNNs where batch normalization is problematic. The authors also propose a data-dependent initialization scheme where g and bias terms are initialized to normalize the initial pre-activations of neurons, helping ensure good scaling of activations across layers at the start of training.",

The intuition is that guidance is harmful at high noise levels (where it causes mode collapse and template-like outputs), largely unnecessary at low noise levels, and only truly beneficial in the middle range. They demonstrate this theoretically using a 1D synthetic example where they can visualize how guidance at high noise levels causes sampling trajectories to drift far from the smoothed data distribution, leading to mode dropping. Beyond this theoretical demonstration, they propose a simple solution of making the guidance weight a piecewise function that only applies guidance within a specific noise level interval.",

This dichotomy makes intuitive sense because not all parts of language processing require long-range dependencies - while some aspects like fact recall or logical reasoning need broad context, others like local grammar or immediate context processing can work with nearby tokens. The paper's approach of using optimization to identify these heads (rather than just looking at attention patterns) is clever because it directly measures the impact on model outputs, capturing the true functional role of each head rather than just its surface behavior. Finally, the insight to maintain two separate KV caches (full for retrieval heads, minimal for streaming heads) is an elegant way to preserve the model's capabilities while reducing memory usage, since it aligns the memory allocation with each head's actual needs.",

Building on this insight, StreamingLLM maintains just a few initial tokens (as attention sinks) along with a sliding window of recent tokens, achieving up to 22.2x speedup compared to baselines while maintaining performance on sequences up to 4 million tokens long. Additionally, they show that incorporating a dedicated learnable \"sink token\" during model pre-training can further improve streaming capabilities by providing an explicit token for collecting excess attention.",

A key insight is that the geometry of attention in LLMs has specific patterns - notably that the initial attention sink token remains almost static regardless of input, and that query and key vectors typically lie in opposite directions - which helps explain why simple TopK selection is suboptimal. Their solution involves a heterogeneous system design that leverages both GPU and CPU resources, with hash computations on GPU and attention computation on CPU, allowing for efficient processing of longer contexts while maintaining accuracy.",

The projection matrix P is carefully constructed (using eigendecomposition of activation statistics) to preserve the most important components while reducing dimensionality, taking advantage of natural redundancies that exist in activation patterns due to properties like the Central Limit Theorem when stacking sequence/batch dimensions. During training, the weights remain uncompressed and fully trainable (maintaining model expressivity), while at inference time, the weight matrices can be pre-multiplied with the projection matrix (PTWᵀ) to achieve compression through matrix multiplication associativity: Y = WᵀX ≈ Wᵀ(PPᵀX) = (PTWᵀ)(PᵀX). This activation-centric approach is fundamentally different from previous methods because it maintains full model expressivity during training while still achieving compression at inference time, and it takes advantage of natural statistical redundancies in activation patterns rather than trying to directly compress weights.",

This approach allows the model to avoid the common posterior collapse problem where latents are ignored when paired with powerful decoders, while still maintaining good reconstruction quality comparable to continuous VAEs.

The parameter update θt ← θt-1 - α·mt/(√vt + ϵ) is invariant to gradient scaling because it uses the ratio mt/√vt, while the adaptive learning rate 1/√vt approximates the diagonal of the Fisher Information Matrix's square root, making it a more conservative version of natural gradient descent that works well with sparse gradients and non-stationary objectives. The hyperparameters β₁ = 0.9 and β₂ = 0.999 mean the momentum term considers roughly the last 10 steps while the variance term considers the last 1000 steps, allowing Adam to both move quickly in consistent directions while being careful in directions with high historical variance.",

    "description": "This paper tackles the challenge of penalizing complexity and preventing overfitting in neural networks. Traditional methods, like L2 regularization, penalize the sum of squared weights but can favor multiple weak connections over a single strong one, leading to suboptimal weight configurations. To address this, the authors propose a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) prior: a narrow Gaussian encourages small weights to shrink to zero, while a broad Gaussian preserves large weights essential for modeling the data accurately. By clustering weights into near-zero and larger groups, this data-driven regularization avoids forcing all weights toward zero equally and demonstrates better generalization on 12 toy tasks compared to early stopping and traditional squared-weight penalties.",

They use a reparameterization and a hybrid learning objective to more tightly optimize the variational lower bound, and find that their objective has less gradient noise during training. They use learned variances and find that they can get convincing samples using fewer steps. They also use the improved precision and recall metrics (Kynkaanniemi et al 2019) to show that diffusion models have higher recall for similar FID, which suggests they cover a large portion of the target distribution. They focused on optimizing log-likelihood as it is believed that optimizing ll forces the model to capture all models of data distribution (Razavi et al 2019). Heninghan et al 2020 has also shown that small improvements in ll can dramatically impact sample quality / learned feature representations. The authors argue that fixing \\sigma_{t} (as Ho et al 2020 does) is reasonable in terms of sample quality, but does not explain much about the ll. Thus, to improve ll they think of finding a better choice for \\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_{t},t), so they choose to try to learn it. They note that it is better to parameterize the var as an interpolation between \\beta_{t} and \\tilde{\\beta_{t}} in the log domain. Remember that \\beta_{t} is the noise schedule, which is typically a small value that increases over time following some schedule. \\tilde{\\beta is a reparameterization of \\beta_{t} used to simplify calculations. They are related via \\alpha, which is 1-\beta_{t}. Finally, they note that a linear schedule for noise leads to faster destroying of information than is necessary, and propose a different noise scheduler. Lots of insights!",

    "venue": "Arxiv",
    "description": "This paper introduces SpeeD, a novel approach for accelerating the training of diffusion models without compromising performance. The authors analyze the diffusion process and identify three distinct areas: acceleration, deceleration, and convergence, each with different characteristics and importance for model training. Based on these insights, SpeeD implements two key components: asymmetric sampling, which reduces the sampling of less informative time steps in the convergence area, and change-aware weighting, which gives more importance to the rapidly changing areas between acceleration and deceleration. The authors' key insight is that not all time steps in the diffusion process are equally valuable for training, with the convergence area providing limited benefits despite occupying a large proportion of time steps, while the rapidly changing area between acceleration and deceleration is crucial but often undersampled. To address this, SpeeD introduces an asymmetric sampling strategy using a two-step probability function: $P(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{k}{T + \\tau(k-1)}, & 0 < t \\leq \\tau \\ \\frac{1}{T + \\tau(k-1)}, & \\tau < t \\leq T \\end{cases}$, where τ is a carefully selected threshold marking the beginning of the convergence area, k is a suppression intensity factor, T is the total number of time steps, and t is the current time step. This function increases sampling probability before τ and suppresses it after. Additionally, SpeeD employs a change-aware weighting scheme based on the gradient of the process increment's variance, assigning higher weights to time steps with faster changes. By combining these strategies, SpeeD aims to focus computational resources on the most informative parts of the diffusion process, potentially leading to significant speedups in training time without sacrificing model quality.",

The noisy versions are represented as xt_{x} and yt_{y}, where t_{x} and t_{y} are the respective timesteps. 2. Use of individual timesteps for different modalities: Instead of using a single timestep t for both modalities, UniDiffuser uses separate timesteps t_{x} and t_{y}. This allows for more flexibility in handling the different characteristics of each modality. 3. Predicting noise for all modalities simultaneously: UniDiffuser uses a joint noise prediction network \\epsilon_{\\theta}(xt_{x},yt_{y},t_{x},t_{y}) that takes in the noisy versions of both modalities and their respective timesteps.

    "description": "This paper introduces classifier-free guidance, a novel technique for improving sample quality in conditional diffusion models without using a separate classifier. Unlike traditional classifier guidance, which relies on gradients from an additional classifier model, classifier-free guidance achieves similar results by combining score estimates from jointly trained conditional and unconditional diffusion models. The method involves training a single neural network that can produce both conditional and unconditional score estimates, and then using a weighted combination of these estimates during the sampling process. This approach simplifies the training pipeline, avoids potential issues associated with training classifiers on noisy data, and eliminates the need for adversarial attacks on classifiers during sampling. The authors demonstrate that classifier-free guidance can achieve a similar trade-off between Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) as classifier guidance, effectively boosting sample quality while reducing diversity. The key difference is that classifier-free guidance operates purely within the generative model framework, without relying on external classifier gradients. This method provides an intuitive explanation for how guidance works: it increases conditional likelihood while decreasing unconditional likelihood, pushing generated samples towards more characteristic features of the desired condition.",

    "description": "Generative modeling has advanced significantly with Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs), but these models often require substantial computational resources. To address this, Diff-Pruning is introduced as a compression method that reduces the computational load by pruning unnecessary diffusion steps, using a Taylor expansion to identify key weights without extensive re-training. Empirical results show that Diff-Pruning can cut FLOPs by around 50%, while maintaining consistent generative performance at only 10-20% of the original training cost.",

    "venue": "NeurIPS",
    "description": "This paper introduces a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) for GANs, and proves that this makes GANs converge to a local Nash equilibrium. More cited is the FID score introduced here. FID improves on IS by comparing the distributions of real and generated images directly. This is done by using the Inception model to extract features from images and then assuming these features follow a multidimensional Gaussian distribution. FID measures the difference between the Gaussians (representing the real and generated images) using the Frechet distance, which effectively captures differences in the mean and covariance (the first two moments) of the distributions. FID makes sense as it directly compares the distributions of real and generated images by using the extracted features from Inception. These features are assumed to follow some multidimensional Gaussian, which simplifies the comparison. The Guassian is chosen as it is the maximum entropy distribution for a given mean and covariance (proof: https://medium.com/mathematical-musings/how-gaussian-distribution-maximizes-entropy-the-proof-7f7dcb2caf4d) -- maximum entropy is important, because this means that the Gaussian makes the fewest additional assumptions about the data, making sure the model is as non-committal as possible given the available information. Then, we calculate the statistics between the real and generated image features, like their mean and covariances. Finally, we compute the FID score using Frechet AKA Wasserstein-2 distance.",

This mask represents which parts of the network are kept (the \"ticket\", or pruned subnet) and which parts are removed. They then consider the scaling factor \"r\" in BN layers as indicators of significance. This r is learned during training and is used to scale normalized activations. The magnitude of r is an indicator of how important the channel is to the network's performance. After deciding which channels to prune based on r, the binary mask is created. If the channel is kept (not pruned), marked as 1 in the mask. Else, 0. For any two subnets, they then compute the \"mask distance\" (AKA Hamming distance) between the two ticketmasks. They measure the mask distance between consequtive epochs and draw EB tickets when such distance is smaller than some threshold.",

They don't explicitly mention how this is done, but one could look at the Hessian of the loss or the magnitude of the weights. I'd imagine you could do this within only a few training iterations. In their \"Regularization\" section, it is interesting to note that L1 regularization (penalizes non-zero params resulting in more params near zero) gave better accuracy after pruning, but before retraining. But, these remaining connections are not as good as with using L2. The authors also present a discussion of what dropout rate to use.",

Thus, they employ a KV Cache eviction method that retains all KV cache (since past evicted tokens may be needed to handle future queries), while being able to select the top K relevant tokens to a particular query.

However, these rankings often are different than reality, so frameworks typically finetune architecture after finding them. BigNAS proposes that this fine-tuning / post-processing is not necessary. They find some interesting points, such as that \"big models converge faster while small child models converge slower\". Thus, at some training step t when the performance of a big model peaks, the small child models are not yet fully-trained, and at a t' where the child models are fully trained, the big model is overfitting. Thus, they use an exponentially decaying with constant ending learning rate scheduler, which has constant learning rate at the end of training when it reaches 5% of initial learning rate. Another point they bring up is a \"coarse-to-fine\" strategy where one first finds a rough sketch of promising network candidates, and then samples multiple finer grained variations around the sketch of interest.",

The paper investigates the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining neural network generalization from a probabilistic perspective and showing that seemingly mysterious results (like fitting random labels) can be reproduced with Gaussian processes.

The method is distinguished by its ability to handle transformations and maintain invariant mappings, demonstrated through experiments that show its effectiveness in preserving neighborhood relationships and accurately mapping new, unseen samples to meaningful locations on the manifold. Unlike methods like LLE, which may struggle with variability and registration issues in input data, DrLIM's contrastive loss function ensures robustness by balancing similarity and dissimilarity in output space, offering a promising approach for applications requiring invariant mappings, such as learning positional information from image sequences in robotics.",

This saturation slows down learning and can cause training plateaus. The difficulty in training deep networks correlates with the singular values of the Jacobian matrix for each layer. When these values deviate significantly from 1, it indicates poor activation and gradient flow across layers, complicating training. New initialization schemes have been proposed to address issues with activation saturation and gradient flow. These schemes aim to achieve faster convergence by ensuring that activations and gradients flow well across layers, thereby improving overall training efficiency.",
